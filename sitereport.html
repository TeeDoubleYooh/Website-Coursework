                    <p class="Half1">Running headfirst into html and CSS, I thought it would be very
                        hard, since we had
                        just flown
                        through python the term before this one. I expected it to be like learning 2 more languages
                        after we had just learnt one a few weeks prior (like learning Spanish in a few months to move
                        onto German and French!). However, html and CSS really clicked with me, and their logic felt
                        super easy to grasp, although there were some bumps in the road, making and designing the
                        website
                        was a lot of fun. One of the hardest parts of the website was actually being able to create the
                        template for the first page. I sifted through so many portfolio examples to find a layout that I
                        thought looked nice and wanted to use. Eventually, I found these 2 portfolios:</p>

                    <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/ronaldo/">Template 1:</a>

                    <p class="Half1">I liked the introduction from this template and its simplicity of
                        just introducing yourself and
                        saying what you do, so I added that to the index page. Also I took inspiration from the website
                        layout having the header and nav on the same row. </p>

                    <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/skater/">Template 2:</a>
                    <p class="Half1">when I saw this template, I knew I wanted a colour scheme and site
                        layout just like this, even
                        though it wasn’t a person’s portfolio as such, so that’s what I did. The grey and orange really
                        suit each other and paired with a nice relaxing image of planets from the NASA website in the
                        middle. I wasn’t too sure on copyright issues, but with how my CSS is made, that image can swap
                        with pretty much anything. I chose Open sans for most of my writing, as it is one of the
                        clearest and professional fonts that doesn’t get too in-your-face. </p>



                    <p class="Half1">The html of the pages felt like the easy part of the job. You just assign
                        variable(class) names
                        to them so you can mess with it in CSS later, however the CSS of the pages turned out to be very
                        time consuming and a lot of trial and error for me, as it is my first-time using html and CSS.
                        The first page definitely took about triple the amount of time to create than all the other
                        pages, as it was just me testing what I thought looked appealing and appropriate for a
                        portfolio, but after that all of the pages felt pretty smooth sailing when designing.</p>

                    <p class="Half1">I did have to make a few changes whilst developing and learning, as I didn’t
                        realise
                        some things I was doing were considered bad practice. In the index I had to make a few changes,
                        because I had completed it using break(br) before I had seen one of Chris’s lectures that told
                        me
                        that br was not to be used, so I changed it to some personalised CSS for the paragraphs that
                        didn’t need its own part in the stylesheet as it was just moving them apart slightly using
                        margin. On the topic of things that couldn’t be used, I wanted to make the project page one box
                        in the middle with a slider attached to it that could cycle through all the different projects I
                        had done, but every single helpful piece of material I could find all used absolute positioning,
                        which was said to be bad practice, so I just went with setting up the projects next to each
                        other and when I need to expand it, I will just go downwards, since I didn’t have time to
                        develop an image slider myself at the time of creating the projects page. </p>

                    <p class="Half1">This module always tested me to think creatively and research how I would want a
                        page to look,
                        and since it was fun to do, I found myself developing until it was super late without realising!
                        If i could change anything, i wouldve put more effort into building and designing the website at
                        the start of the module, as i didnt realise just how time consuming building a website from
                        scratch really is!
